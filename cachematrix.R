## This file describes two functions. 
## The makeCacheMatrix function creates a
## special kind of matrix that can be inverted
## by calling cacheSolve. 

## Creates a special kind of matrix that can
## be inverted using cacheSolve

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Takes a special kind of matrix returned by
## makeCacheMatrix and looks for the cached 
## inverse of that matrix. If it hasn't been
## computed before it computes it using solve()
## and caches the result for next time.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
